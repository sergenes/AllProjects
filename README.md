# AllProjects
This is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that allows you to keep track of all your projects in one place. With this plugin, you can always recall what you accomplished and when, even after several weeks or months. Every programmer understands the occasional need to report to their manager about what they accomplished on a specific day weeks ago. This plugin is compatible with most of JetBrains' IDEs.
